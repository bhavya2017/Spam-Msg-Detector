## Dataset

The **SMS Spam Collection** is a dataset containing 5,574 SMS messages in English, labeled as either "ham" (legitimate) or "spam". This collection has been gathered for research purposes in the area of SMS spam detection. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for developing and evaluating machine learning models for classifying SMS messages.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to building an AI model capable of classifying SMS messages as either spam or legitimate. To achieve this, we will employ natural language processing techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings. The classified data will then be used with machine learning classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify and categorize spam messages effectively.
